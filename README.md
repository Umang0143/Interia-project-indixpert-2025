Project Title
Interia

Project Description
Overview:
Interia is a refined, visually elegant single-page website template crafted for interior designers, architecture studios, and home decor consultants. The design emphasizes modern aesthetics, clean layouts, and strong visuals to showcase projects, services, and client credibility.

Objective for UI Developer:
Develop a responsive, pixel-accurate HTML/CSS/JS version of the Interia landing page based on the Figma design. The final build should reflect the sophisticated design feel, prioritize image presentation, and ensure smooth interaction and performance across all screen sizes.
